										<h1>University Experience</h1>

										<h2>Knowledge</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Being at Southwestern Adventist University was extremely valueable to my learning, both in the classroom and out. While I did learn a lot from being in the classes, I gained just as much if not more outside the classroom. Because I was attending SWAU, I was able to gain an internship with David Mendoza as a Junior developer. That experience helped me learn about what it is like to work in that field, and it gave me a good amount of knowlegde to take with me to my next job. I also worked as a computer lab technician for Dr. Thomas. Through working at that job, I learned a lot about managing a network and how to manage workstations. I would not have learned that if not for that job.</p>

										<h2>Faith</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This is a complicated subject for me. When I came to SWAU, I was expecting to be spiritually uplifted by attending and that somehow I would become more spiritual. That is not the case. However, I do not want to blame the school for this, as there were a multitude of opportunities to enhance my spirituality. That being said, I no longer consider myself spiritual nor religious. Being in a college enviornment helped connect me with those who did not share my worldview, even if it was at a Christian university. As a result, I believe I am more tolerant of other's beliefs and worldviews.</p>
									<header>
										<h2>Service</h2>
									</header>
									<p>There are many, many opportunities to serve at SWAU. Not only are there events for students to partake in, I was also encouraged in my classes to serve as well. There were a couple times where I went to an event specifically to serve, but I think that what was even more valuable was contributing to the friendly enviornment at SWAU by helping out other students and guests whenever I could. This included helping out underclassmen to study, attending or promoting events from the Computer Science club, as well as helping out those in the community. These interactions helped me become more aware of how I can be of service to others.</p>
