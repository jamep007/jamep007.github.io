									<p>My Introduction to LAN Technology class was a very difficult class, and one of the hardest in my time at SWAU. We were told at the beginning of the semester that by the end, we need to take a big exam, the CompTIA Network+ certification exam. The stakes were high: if we passed, we would gain a valuable certification and the knowledge that came with it. If we failed, not only would we have wasted money, but we would also have to spend more to take the test again. I have not studied for a class more than I have for this one. We learned about a variety of topics in LAN technology, including how a network functions, the physical connectivity, as well as the many protocols that existed. Yet, past all those challenges, I was able to pass the exam and gain that certification.</p>

									<p>This presentation was to be the conclusion and finale to a year’s worth of study in game design, specifically with Unreal Engine 4. In one semester, I learned about the vast number of functions that UE4 has to offer, along with major game design concepts, such as line tracing. In the next semester, I learned about VR design, as well as how to use UE4 to create games in VR. For the presentation itself, I had to somehow figure out how to convey a year’s worth of studying and research within 45 minutes. I was not sure if it was even possible. However, at the end of my senior year, I made my presentation, which was well received. I even got someone who was not a Computer Science major to be interested in learning UE4 and VR design.</p>

									<p>Being in the Internet Of Things class, we were taught to be very hands-on. Dr. Thomas wanted us to experience what it was like to configure a new network full of IOT technology. This document was relaying our experience working with these devices. A quick summary: IOT is still in its infancy. What I mean by that is that a lot of it was still difficult to use and navigate. We learned a lot about how the technology functions, but I would not wish for anyone to try and duplicate our project. It was incredibly frustrating, as kept running into issue after issue. In the end, we got the project to work, but not without a good number of headaches.</p>

									<p>In my Application Development for Event-Driven GUI Appl. class, we learned about how to design GUIs using JAVA Swing. It was interesting to learn how to use, because before, we were merely printing lines to the terminal. This time, we had to think about how we wanted to present the project to normal users. I had to research how most people prefer to interact with their programs, as well as design philosophies that made the project more difficult. I had to do a lot of research about how to implement specific widgets for most of the project as well. I wasn't able to do quite as much as I wanted, but I was able to add a simple and intuitive program where the user can select Pokemon and battle with them. I utilized logic from a previous project, but I had to completely remake significant portions of it to get the widgets to function properly. All in all, I enjoyed being able to desing GUIs, which only made me want to work in that field more.</p>
