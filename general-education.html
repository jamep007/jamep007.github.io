									<p>Completing this research paper from my Research Writing class truly helped me learn about the importance of research. Normally, you may be inclined to believe information simply because it fits into your worldview or because it is intuitive to you. However, you should always take the time to become informed before deciding on what you believe. For example, in this research paper, I came into it thinking that there may be some research that suggests that video games could be detrimental. However as I investigated this topic, I found that there were numerous benefits, and that there isn't much research to support the idea that video games could be harmful. Now, I know to look beyond the surface, and to check the finer details.</p>

									<p>I selected this artifact because of how I learned about the importance of being able to rely on others. I remember not studying for this exam, which made me worry that I would not pass. However, I hesitated to ask my classmates to help. Then, a classmate reached out to me, wanting to study. I know for a fact I did as well as I did because I was able to study with others. This taught me that if I want to succeed, I need to be good at working with others. In the future, I will not hesitate to reach out to others when I need help.</p>

									<p>I selected this artifact because this reaction essay really stood out to me. I was shocked to see the above image, especially because I didn't know that self-immolation existed. When I reacted to this, I remember thinking about how awful it was that someone felt the need to do something so drastic. While this should never happen again, we as citizens must be involved in our government so that we can influence and perhaps change policies that will impact our lives. This assignment taught me to be more active and vocal when things need to change.</p>

									<p>This artifact also stood out to me because it was the test results for my first Discrete Structures exam. Discrete Structures is often talked about being the introductory class to Computer Science, which helps you learn how to think like a Computer Scientist. Studying for this class was like nothing that I had done before and nothing could've prepared me for it. However, I was able to adapt, learn, and show my knowledge in this exam. I ended up being one of two people to get an A for that first exam.</p>

									<p>This was the big exam for my first upper-division religion course, Introduction To The New Testament. I knew straight away what topic I was going to talk about when this was assigned to me. I had been questioning those past few weeks what it truly meant to be a "good Christian". Working on this essay helped me explore what that means according to the bible, rather than letting people explain it to me. In this essay, I was able to identify the core ideas from the Sermon on the Mount, but I do not think I was as thorough as I could have been. I was limited by the scope of the project, but I was at least able to answer my biggest questions.</p>

									<p>In my Discussion Techniques class, we were learning how to effectively work as a team. The previous project was very easy because we had a lot of time to work on it. However, this project had a much shorter timeframe. So, we worked on it straight away. One of our group members wasn't as efficient as I wish he could've been. He also missed a couple group meetings, which put a strain on the group. However, we were able to learn to work around these issues and complete the project. This project helped me learn how to be patient, cooperate, and compensate for members of my team.</p>

									<p>Throughout Principles of Programming 1, we were focusing on learning the programming language PHP. In order to show off what we had learned, Espinosa told us to create a website, utilizing a database. I remember this was my first big project when it comes to Computer Science, and I wanted it to be a success. I ended up working with a classmate of mine to finish the project, which helped me better learn how to deal with SQL queries and a MySQL database. I was able to show off my skills with PHP and HTML, which allowed me to successfully create a functional webpage, complete with user accounts, and retrieving data from a database.</p>
