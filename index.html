											<h1>James A. Reynolds</h1>
											<p>Personal Statement</p>
										</header>
										<p>Even when I was a child, there were two aspects of myself that have led me to where I am today. One of them being that I consider myself highly creative. I love designing things and coming up with ideas on how to solve problems. The other is that I highly enjoy the technical side of things. I like being able to increase my knowledge about a variety of subjects, and I enjoy it when I can show my mastery over the things I have learned. Growing up, I was encouraged to shoot for the stars, but how could I do such a thing when I often felt drawn to two seemingly different areas of life? On one hand, I enjoy writing stories and creating art, while on the other, I enjoyed learning about computers, and using math equations?<br><br>
											I finally found the answer in 8th grade. During a class where we learned about the many career options out there, I stumbled into software engineering. When I investigated it, I finally found something that truly captivated my interest. While using my technical abilities, I would be able to design entire programs using my creativity! Knowing instantly what I wanted to do, I have dived headfirst into preparing myself for that career.<br><br>
											While my ideals pushed me into the direction of software engineering, the fact was that I still needed to learn so much before I could enter that field. Being highly motivated to succeed, I learned as much as I could about computers and how they work. I even built my PC when I was 16. When I moved on to college, I decided to major in Computer Science at Southwestern Adventist University. During my time at SWAU, I learned a variety of programming languages, earned a CompTIA Network+ certification, applied myself in an internship, and even became president in the Computer Science club. I finally am in a position where I can pursue my dreams.<br><br>
											However, it has not been an easy journey. While I have been pushing myself to do the best I could in learning, I had to overcome many financial hardships. Neither my mother nor my father has completed college, so I am the first in my family to get a college degree. On top of that, I was raised in a single-parent household. My mother has tried her best, but it is only because of a vast amount of help that I was able to afford college. More than that, learning what it takes to succeed in software engineering and computer science was extremely difficult. There were many sleepless nights and much frustration. I worked hard to attain my college degree, but in the process, I have learned many valuable life skills. I learned how to manage my time, how to communicate effectively, and how to work with others.<br><br>
											Where do I go from here? I believe that because of my experiences, along with my passion to learn and create, I can make my greatest contributions by creating new software, specifically web development and mobile application development. I believe that my drive will allow me to excel and be an asset wherever I go. I am excited to continue to be even better at what I do.</p>
